        "\n",
        "The os.fork() function is a low-level system call that creates a new child process by duplicating the parent process. It is available only on Unix-based systems (Linux, macOS) and is not supported on Windows.\n",
        "\n",
        "How os.fork() Works:\n",
        "\n",
        "When os.fork() is called, it creates an exact copy of the current process.\n",
        "\n",
        "The child process gets a unique process ID (PID) but shares memory space with the parent.\n",

When a file is opened using Python’s built-in open() function, the operating system allocates resources to handle the file. Failing to close the file properly can lead to several issues, such as data corruption, memory leaks, and system resource exhaustion.\n",

        " = Multithreading is important in certain applications because it allows for better utilization of system resources, improved performance, and enhanced responsiveness. By enabling multiple threads to execute concurrently within a single process, applications can handle multiple tasks efficiently and achieve better parallelism.\n",
        "\n",
        "Key Benefits of Using Multithreading:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Improved Performance Through Concurrency:\n",
        "\n",
        "Multithreading allows a program to perform multiple operations at the same time, such as handling user input while processing data in the background.\n",
        "\n",
        "It is particularly useful for I/O-bound operations (e.g., network requests, file operations) where the CPU would otherwise be idle while waiting for responses.\n",
